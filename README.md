This script autoattach YubiKey to the GPG Qube. Based on Micah Lee's [script](https://micahflee.com/2016/12/qubes-tip-making-yubikey-openpgp-smart-cards-slightly-more-usable/). The udev rule has to be installed to `sys-usb` - Qubes's [documentation](https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/yubi-key/) describes the process.
